Disc #1 has 5 positions; at time=0, it is at position 4.
Disc #2 has 2 positions; at time=0, it is at position 1.

k = the value we are looking for
n = Disk #n

k + n = (positions - current_position) % positions

k + 1 = 5 - 4 % 5
k + 2 = 2 - 1 % 2

k + 1 = 1 % 5
k + 2 = 1 % 2

k = 5

6 = 1 % 5
7 = 1 % 2

---

k + 1 = 1 % 5 <=> k = 0 % 5
k + 2 = 1 % 2 <=> k = 1 % 2

k = 0 + (5 * n)
k = 1 + (2 * n)
